# OCR
This repository contains the Project of MicrocontrollersAndMore, “Opencv 3 license plate recognition cpp.” https://github.com/MicrocontrollersAndMore/OpenCV 3 License Plate Recognition Cpp with some modifications mention in Readme 

The changes added to this project:

1) Retraining the OCR and adding dutch license plate font to improve the character detection. training_chars.png is used to train
the OCR

2) Improving the OCR by adding the probability of detection of each segment so then lower than some probability the 
detection would be discarded. 

The rest of code is exactly the same as the source as the following direction:
